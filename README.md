Breast Cancer AI Detector

This project involves creating an AI model to detect breast cancer using medical scans. Developed on Google Colab, the AI system analyzes scans to determine if cancer is present, identifies the type of cancer, and provides additional diagnostic information.

The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset, leveraging machine learning techniques to achieve accurate and reliable results. The project highlights skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It also demonstrates proficiency in using Python and AI frameworks, as well as working with real-world datasets for impactful healthcare applications.
